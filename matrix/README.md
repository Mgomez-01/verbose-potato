    completed the first set of operations that seemed useful, addition, multiplication, printing
    etc. 

    will add unary subtraction as well as proper matrix multiplication
## Purpose: For use in some visualization efforts for Neural Networks From Scratch 

## Timeline: Whenever at the moment, but shoot for having something workable in a few hours.
