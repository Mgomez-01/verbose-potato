# matrix

## Goals: Program a simple class for performing matrix operations. 
    completed the first set of operations that seemed useful, addition, multiplication, printing
    etc. 

    will add unary subtraction as well as proper matrix multiplication. It very well could be a simple change to make this work as a struct instead of a class in and of itself. I will think about this and maybe reconsider the stance I am currently at. 
## Purpose: For use in some visualization efforts for Neural Networks From Scratch 

## Timeline: Whenever at the moment, but shoot for having something workable in a few hours.
