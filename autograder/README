To run: download all the submissions from canvas (shoudl give you submissions.zip)
Copy that here
mkdir submissions
cp submissions.zip submissions
cd submissions
unzip submissions.zip # canvas doesn't put them in a folder, so unzipping will put them all in the cwd
cd ..
# you are here by default autograder will look at all the .c files in the submissions directory
./autograder.py > outputFile.txt # probably easiest to save the output in a file


It will print lots of info, and then all the grades at the end.
If a student doesn't score 100, find their name in the noisy output at the top,
and copy what they got wrong into the comments on canvas

It's probably easiest to use speedgrader on Canvas.
